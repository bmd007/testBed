-create a flutter client
-connect the backend to user service oauth
-make clients use oauth tokens instead of baisc auth user/pass
-make the backend use activeMQ
-make the clients work with activeMQ (should be no difference)
-make clients authenticate against activeMQ as well (if needed) (by connecting activeMQ to oauth service)
