/**
 * This Client calls the resources defined in this package.
 * This behaviour is due to partitioning of the kafka and limited access of each
 * KafkaStream application instance to each view (KTABLE). So in order to query each KTABLE,
 * if the requested data is not accessible for the ?answering? instance, using this client,
 * that instance will redirect the question to another instance.
 * The port and ip address of each instance is configured as a property of kafkaStream; so each instance
 * is aware that who has access to what portion of data (by fetching metaData from kafka).
